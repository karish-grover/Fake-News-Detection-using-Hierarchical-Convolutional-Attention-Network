# Fake News Detection using Hierarchical Convolutional Attention Network

This project was carried out as a part of the Natural Language Processing - NLP (CSE556) course project, at IIIT Delhi. 

# Abstract
In today’s digital era, social media platforms’ popularity has increased exponentially, lead- ing to an increase in the amount of unreliable information online. Verifying the integrity of a particular piece of news is not easy for any end-user. In this paper, our end goal is to design an efficient model to examine the reliability of a news piece. This paper addresses the problem of Fake News classification, given only the news piece content and the author name. We present, **Hierarchical Convolutional-Attention Network (HCAN)** composed of attention-enhanced word-level and sentence-level encoders and a CNN to capture the sequential correlation. Extensive experiments show that HCAN outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines models on a Kaggle dataset. 

_The figure below shows the motivation behind relative importance of words and sentences in a news piece._
